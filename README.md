<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## PREDICTING FLIGHT DELAY

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict flight delays using historical flight data. The primary goal is to build a predictive system that can estimate flight delays based on various features, such as departure time, weather conditions, and flight details. The project covers the entire data processing pipeline and machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), and XGBoost, all of which were implemented to predict flight delays. Additionally, a simple interface was developed to allow users to input flight details and receive real-time predictions about delays. The application integrates the machine learning model to provide quick and easy predictions based on live input.

### Built With

* Languages: Python, Jupyter Notebook
* Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
* Web Development: Flask/Django for building the web application, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the interface.
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## My Contribution

I contributed to the following parts of the project:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handled cleaning and preparation of the dataset, including dealing with missing values, duplicates, and ensuring the data was suitable for modeling.

2. Machine Learning Models:
 * Implemented Logistic Regression to model flight delay predictions.
 * Developed a Random Forest model to improve prediction accuracy.
3. Web Application: Built a simple web interface to allow users to input flight details and receive real-time flight delay predictions, integrating the trained machine learning models for seamless interaction.
